# Quizatron
A cross platfrom Quiz presentation application designed to run on long quiz shows that require a dedicated display screen and a console.

## Motivation
Designing and running quizzes in powerpoint is a pain and confusing. Especially because of the lack of conditional manipulation of the quiz states and the ability to take control of the quiz.
Quizatron was built specifically for running long quiz shows in front of a large audience without having to display the file explorer and run how a quiz program should run. Equipped with a media player, a score board display and 5 quiz round types,
Quizatron delivers a perfect quiz show and a console to have full control of the program, even if something goes wrong.

**Quizatron** has been used to run [Inquizzitive 15](http://facebook.com/inquizzitive15/) flawlessly. 

## Getting started

### Installation

Written in Java, Quizatron can run everywhere with a JVM. The easiest way to get started is by downloading a packaged binary.
Platform specific binaries will be available soon.

Quizatron also has a JAR file available which has to be run by the Oracle JDK 8 runtime.

To build the project from source:
`git clone https://github.com/2DSharp/Quizatron.git `

Detailed information on building the project will be out soon.

### Running a Quiz

You need to feed a configuration file to run a quiz. Details will be published soon.
